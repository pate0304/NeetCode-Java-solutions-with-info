/**
 * NeetCode Problem 5 (Two Pointers): Trapping Rain Water
 * 
 * Problem Description:
 * Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1,
 * compute how much water it can trap after raining.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1].
 * In this case, 6 units of rain water are being trapped.
 * 
 * Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
 * Output: 9
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - n == height.length
 * - 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
 * - 0 <= height[i] <= 10^5
 * 
 * Approach:
 * The key insight is that the amount of water trapped at any position depends on the
 * minimum of the maximum heights to its left and right, minus its own height.
 * 
 * There are several approaches to solve this problem:
 * 
 * 1. Brute Force: For each position, find the maximum height to its left and right,
 *    then calculate the water trapped. O(nÂ²) time complexity.
 * 
 * 2. Dynamic Programming: Precompute the maximum height to the left and right of each position,
 *    then calculate the water trapped. O(n) time and O(n) space complexity.
 * 
 * 3. Two Pointers: Use two pointers to track the maximum heights from both ends,
 *    and calculate the water trapped while moving the pointers. O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.
 * 
 * We'll implement the Two Pointers approach as it's the most efficient:
 * 1. Use two pointers, left and right, starting from the ends of the array
 * 2. Keep track of the maximum heights seen so far from both ends
 * 3. Move the pointer pointing to the smaller height inward
 * 4. Calculate the water trapped at each position
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the array
 * Space Complexity: O(1) as we're using constant extra space
